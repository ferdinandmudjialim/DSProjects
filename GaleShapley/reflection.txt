I think the difficulty of this assignment was reasonable. All in all, it took us about four to five hours to complete the project. One of the most important lessons that I learned was to always debug incrementally with something like PyCharm. It really helps to know what part of your code isn't working before moving on to implement another part. I also learned that checking the results by hand before coding is helpful to get an understanding of what the code should do and what it should not. As a pair, we both contributed about an equal weight in the project and also used pair programming to implement most of the code. When we were stuck, we would try to come up with our own solutions, but it usually converged towards the same concept that we could later implement in the actual code. Overall, I think each partner did their part in this project.
